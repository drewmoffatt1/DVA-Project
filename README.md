## Application Overview
PJM is a regional transmission organization (RTO) that manages transmission of electricity for 21 utilities in mid-Atlantic and mid-west states of the US. Each utility in PJMâ€™s territory comprises its own transmission zone. PJM and its member utilities use load forecasts to allocate capacity efficiently, affordably, safely, and reliably. Accurate load forecasting is integral to maintaining a positive reputation with customers, preventing litigation issues, and keeping unexpected/emergency costs down. This visualization tool allows users to interact with the load forecasts. It automatically pulls in weather forecasts to engineer the predictor variables that feed into the final XGBoost models to predict load. The tool is built in Streamlit and utilitizes Folium for mapping and Plotly for interactivity.
